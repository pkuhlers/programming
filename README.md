This is a repo for random languages I learn and non-serious projects.

c_cpp/ has some C and C++ code that comes from books I'm reading from here: https://greenteapress.com/wp/

javascript/ has html and javascript to make some random animations. It's pretty much all code I've copied and modified from the Internet.
